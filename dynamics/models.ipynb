    "In evaluating the aerodynamic and/or hydrodynamic forces/powers during landing (on water or not), I adopt the following models, to first-order approximation. Three scenarios are considered: (1) Steady flight before landing (wings), (2) Slowing down to land (wings and/or skiing), (3) Water-skiing. Here, the avocet and the shoveler takes the (2) and (3) route, respectively in decelerating to land. We shall neglect the final phase of \"stopping\" (standing for avocet).\n",
